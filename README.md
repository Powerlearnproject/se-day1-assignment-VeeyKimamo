#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering involves the organized use of engineering principles, techniques, and tools to create and sustain high-quality software systems. This process includes the design, development, testing, deployment, and upkeep of software products. 
Importance: Software engineering is essential to the technology industry, as it enables the development of software applications and systems that drive key aspects of modern life, such as communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.	Creation of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C): The invention of early programming languages like Fortran and C laid the foundation for software development by providing tools to write and execute complex code.

2.	Formation of software engineering as a discipline (1960s): software engineering emerged as a formal discipline, emphasizing the application of engineering principles to systematically develop and manage software.

3.	Introduction of structured programming (1970s): the rise of structured programming, which brought about a more organized and readable approach to coding, making software easier to debug and maintain. 

4.	Emergence of agile methodologies (2000s): The early 2000s marked the adoption of agile methodologies, which promoted flexibility, iterative development, and close collaboration between teams and customers.




List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.	Requirements: Collecting and documenting the needs and specifications of users and the system.
2.	Design: Developing both high-level and detailed plans for the software's architecture and user interface.
3.	Implementation: Coding and constructing the software based on the design specifications.
4.	Testing: Performing various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and fulfills functional requirements.
5.	Deployment: Delivering the software to users or customers.
6.	Maintenance: Offering continuous support, updates, and improvements to the software post-deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology:
Definition: Waterfall is a sequential approach to software development, where each phase (such as requirements, design, and implementation) follows the previous one in a linear progression, resembling the flow of a waterfall.
Characteristics:
•	Each phase is completed before the next one begins.
•	Changes are difficult to accommodate once a phase is completed.
•	Detailed documentation is created at each phase.
•	The entire project scope is usually defined upfront.
Example: Waterfall is ideal for projects with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change, such as government contracts, where a clear plan and strict adherence to timelines are critical.

Agile Methodology:
Definition: Agile is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility, close collaboration with stakeholders, and the ability to adapt to changes throughout the development process.
Characteristics:
•	Development is divided into small, manageable iterations or sprints.
•	Regular feedback and collaboration with customers and stakeholders are key.
•	The project evolves as new requirements or changes arise.
•	Less emphasis on comprehensive documentation, more on working software.
Example: Agile is suitable for projects where requirements are expected to evolve, such as a software startup developing a new product, where rapid delivery, customer feedback, and flexibility are essential for success.




Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: tasked with coding and implementing software solutions.
Quality assurance engineer: focuses on maintaining software quality by creating and carrying out test plans.
Project manager: manages the planning, execution, and successful delivery of software projects.




Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
Definition: IDEs are software suites that offer a wide range of tools to assist in writing, debugging, and testing code, all within a single interface. 
Examples include Visual Studio, Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEA.
Importance:
1.	Efficiency: IDEs streamline the development process by providing code editors, compilers, and debugging tools in one place, reducing the need to switch between different applications.
2.	Productivity: Features like code completion, syntax highlighting, and error detection help developers write code faster and with fewer errors.
3.	Collaboration: Many IDEs offer plugins and integrations that facilitate team collaboration, version control, and project management within the same environment.


Version Control Systems (VCS):
Definition: VCS are tools that track changes made to source code, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously while keeping a history of all modifications. 
Examples include Git and Subversion.
Importance:
1.	Collaboration: VCS enables teams to work together on the same codebase without overwriting each other's changes, making it easier to manage contributions from multiple developers.
2.	History and Revisions: VCS keeps a detailed history of all changes, allowing developers to revert to previous versions of the code if something goes wrong or to understand how the code has evolved over time.
3.	Conflict Resolution: VCS helps in resolving conflicts when multiple developers make changes to the same part of the code, ensuring that the final version integrates everyone's contributions.




What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges:
1.	Evolving requirements: during the development process, requirements often shift, leading to scope creep and potential project delays.
2.	Tight deadlines: the need to meet strict deadlines can cause rushed development, which may compromise the quality of the software.
3.	Technical debt: accumulating technical debt from quick fixes or poor solutions can hinder future development and increase the cost of maintenance.

Strategies to overcome challenges:
1.	Effective communication: clear and ongoing communication with stakeholders and team members helps manage expectations and address issues promptly.
2.	Agile methodologies: utilizing agile approaches allows teams to adapt to changing requirements more smoothly and maintain flexibility throughout the project.
3.	Task prioritization: focusing on the most critical tasks first ensures that essential features are completed on time, helping to manage deadlines and maintain quality.
4.	Regular reassessment: continuously reviewing and adjusting project goals and timelines helps keep the project on track and addresses emerging challenges early.




Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit testing
Description: focuses on testing individual components or modules of the software. Each unit, which is typically a function or method, is tested in isolation to verify that it performs as expected.
Importance: This type of testing helps catch defects early in the development process. By isolating and testing components individually, developers can identify and fix issues before they affect other parts of the system. Unit testing ensures that each piece of the software works correctly on its own.

 2. Integration testing
Description: involves testing the interactions between different components or subsystems to ensure they work together as intended. This type of testing checks that the interfaces between units function correctly and that data flows properly between components.
Importance: integration testing ensures that these components function well together. It helps identify issues that may not be apparent when components are tested in isolation, such as problems with data exchange or interface mismatches.

 3. System testing
Description: involves testing the entire software system. This type of testing verifies that the integrated components meet the specified requirements, and that the software performs its intended functions.
Importance: provides a comprehensive evaluation of the software's functionality and performance. It helps ensure that all components and subsystems work together correctly, and that the software meets the specified requirements and quality standards.

 4. Acceptance testing
Description: conducted to validate the software against user requirements. This type of testing ensures that the software meets the needs and expectations of its end users.
Importance: crucial for confirming that the software delivers the desired value and satisfies user needs. It helps ensure that the final product aligns with the intended business goals and requirements before it is delivered to the customer or end user.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Definition:  involves designing and crafting questions or statements to find the most relevant and accurate responses from AI models. It is a crucial practice in optimizing interactions with AI systems, particularly those based on natural language processing like chatgpt.
Importance in interacting with AI models:
1.	Enhancing response quality:
Well-crafted prompts can guide the AI to generate responses that are more relevant and accurate. 
2.	Improving clarity and precision:
Effective prompts can reduce ambiguity and ensure that the AI model’s responses are clear and precise.
3.	Reducing errors and misinterpretations:
Proper prompt engineering minimizes the risk of misinterpretation by the AI by framing prompts in a way that is easy for the AI to understand.
4.	Optimizing performance:
Prompt engineering can help optimize the performance of AI models by making it easier for them to focus on the relevant aspects of a query.
5.	Facilitating better user experience:
By crafting effective prompts, users can achieve more satisfactory and useful responses from the AI.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Describe multispecies environment sharing effect on parasite transmission.

Improved prompt: Explain how the presence of multiple host species at Lewa conservancy affects the transmission dynamics of Rhipicephalus appendiculatus ticks and provide examples of how this interaction can influence infection rates in each species.

Reasons for improved effectiveness:
1. Contextual specificity:
The improved prompt specifies the location (Lewa conservancy), which provides context about the environment where the interaction occurs. This detail helps the AI model focus on the relevant ecological setting, leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.
2. Targeted subject:
The improved prompt identifies a specific parasite (Rhipicephalus appendiculatus ticks), which narrows the focus of the discussion. This specificity allows the AI to provide detailed information about that parasite, rather than giving a general overview that might lack depth.
3. Focused inquiry:
By asking how the presence of multiple host species affects the transmission dynamics, the improved prompt directs the AI to analyze and explain the specific impact on tick transmission dynamics. This targeted question helps in obtaining a response that directly addresses the relationship between host species and parasite transmission.
4. Request for examples:
The improved prompt includes a request for examples of how interactions between host species and ticks influence infection rates. This helps in obtaining a more comprehensive and illustrative response, making the explanation clearer and more practical.
5. Detailed scope:
The improved prompt’s detailed scope (specific location, parasite, and type of interaction) ensures that the response is well-defined and focused. This prevents the response from being too broad or generic and enhances its relevance to the specific subject of study.
